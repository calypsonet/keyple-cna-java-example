# Contributing to CNA Code Examples

**Welcome and thank you for your interest in contributing!**

This repository is maintained by the Calypso Networks Association (CNA) as a shared space for code examples related to
the Calypso technology. Whether you're fixing a bug, improving documentation, submitting ideas, or contributing a new
example, your help is appreciated.

## Quick Start

1. **Check Existing Examples**  
   Browse the repository to see if a similar example or contribution already exists. This helps avoid duplication and
   gives you a feel for the structure and style.

2. **Open an Issue**  
   If you have a suggestion, question, or a need for a specific example or clarification, feel free
   to [open an issue](https://github.com/calypsonet/keyple-cna-java-example/issues).  
   You can use issues to:
    - Describe a missing example you'd like to see.
    - Report unclear or incomplete documentation.
    - Request clarification or expansion of a specific topic.
    - Propose new features or improvements.

3. **Fork the Repository**  
   Make your changes in your own fork. When you're ready, submit a pull request (PR) for review.

## What Can You Contribute?

- **New Code Examples**  
  Share concise, focused examples that illustrate how to use specific Keyple or Calypso features. Clearly document what
  the example is intended to demonstrate.

- **Improvements to Existing Examples**  
  This includes fixing errors, clarifying explanations, refactoring code, or updating deprecated usage.

- **Documentation Enhancements**  
  Add missing details, improve readability, or translate documentation if relevant.

- **Feedback and Needs**  
  You donâ€™t need to submit code to contribute! Describing your use case, what you're trying to achieve, or what kind of
  example would help you is already a valuable contribution.  
  Please use GitHub issues to let us know.

## Guidelines

- Keep examples simple and focused on a single use case when possible.
- Write clear, commented code.
- Prefer Java when submitting code, unless the example is meant to demonstrate a specific cross-platform or tooling use.
- Follow the file organization pattern used in the repository.
- Include a brief `README.md` in the example directory explaining what it does and how to run it.
